This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java that can occur when traversing arrays. The Bug.java file shows the erroneous code, while BugSolution.java provides the corrected version.  The error arises from an incorrect loop condition, leading to an attempt to access an array element beyond its valid index range. This results in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The solution corrects the loop condition to avoid this error.
